# YaaS Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the contribution guidelines for Yet Another As-a Service (YaaS)! If you're looking to add your touch to our remarkably unproductive project, you're in the right place. Before you start, make sure you're in the right frame of mind for contributing to a service that prides itself on achieving absolutely nothing.

## Getting Started

First, do nothing. 🥳 Great job! You're already on your way to becoming a top contributor to YaaS.

## Contribution Ideas

We're always looking for innovative ways to do less. Here are some areas you might consider:

- **Adding More Nothing**: 🚀 If you can think of new ways to do nothing, we're all ears.
- **Enhancing Existing Nothing**: 🤫 Got an idea to make our current nothing even less impactful? Perfect.
- **Buzzword Implementation**: 💬 If there's a buzzword we missed, we need it. It doesn’t have to mean anything (indeed, most of them don't).

## How to Submit Contributions

1. **Think About It**: 💭 Spend a considerable amount of time just thinking about your contribution. No need to rush.
2. **Procrastinate**: ⏳ Put off actually doing anything about it. The best ideas come when you're not working on them.
3. **Write Something**: 🖋️ If you must write code, make sure it adds no value whatsoever.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: 📤 Whenever you get around to it, submit a pull request. We might review it, or we might be busy doing nothing.

## Code of Conduct

- **Relax**: 😌 We're not doing anything important here.
- **Be Respectful**: 🤝 Even in the realm of nothingness, kindness is something.
- **Procrastinate Responsibly**: 🚦 Make sure your procrastination doesn't accidentally become productive.

## Additional Tips

- **Don’t Break Things**: 🔨 Not that it matters, but try not to break the nothing we already have.
- **The Less, The Better**: 👌 The best contribution is the one that doesn't add to the workload.
- **Documentation**: 📝 Feel free to write extensive documentation about your contribution. It's the best way to look busy without actually doing anything.

## Final Thoughts

Remember, YaaS is all about embracing the art of doing nothing as efficiently as however it ends up. 🌌 Welcome to the team! 🎊
