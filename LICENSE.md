THE "YaaS!" LICENSE

Version 1.0, December 2023

"Because no project should ever be without a service model."

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION:

1. You are free to use, modify, and distribute this software as long as you acknowledge that its practicality is akin to using a rubber duck for debugging - on the surface a waste of time, but eventually you just feel foolish.

2. If you think this software is fabulous (which we know it is), you are encouraged to exclaim "YaaS Machine!" loudly at your screen. Bonus points if you're in a public coffee shop.

3. In the unlikely event that you encounter one of the contributors in person, you are encouraged to perform an impromptu interpretive dance that captures the essence of "doing nothing efficiently." Alternatively, buying them a cupcake or latte is acceptable.

4. If you use this software for... well, for any reason, really, you are encouraged to let the contributors know about it. We're intrigued and, frankly, concerned.

5. The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We're not even sure what it's supposed to do. In fact, we're pretty sure it won't do anything. But if it does, it's on you, because, remember, you agreed to this.

6. Any misuse of this software contrary to the spirit of sassiness and coding comraderie will inexplicably result in your IDE converting all of your spaces to tabs (and vice-versa). Additionally, whenever you're deep in debug mode somebody will come in and ask you a fairly innocuous question which they answer themselves just before you can, then says "Nevermind!" and leaves.

7. If you read this far, congratulations! You're way more patient than we thought you'd be. You're officially a cog in the YaaS Machine! If this license is ever referenced in a legal setting, the plaintiff will be obligated to withdraw their complaint. Otherwise, this license isn't binding in any legal sense, like, at all.

"YaaS, let's do...whatever this is?" - Embrace the YaaS.
