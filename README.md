## Getting Started

There are two ways to start using YaaS:

### Quickstart 🏁

The fastest way to start using YaaS is to simply do nothing. Yes, it's that easy!

### Slowburn 🔥🐢🔥

The less quick way to start using YaaS is to start with some planning meetings. It's best to make sure you're not wasting people's time, though, so it's probably best to have some pre-planning meetings with key developers in your organization. In order to save time, it's advised that you get as many developers and stakeholders throughout the company to attend a meeting together so as to avoid lengthy delays with rescheduling and conflicts in communication. If anyone says this is stupid and that the meetings should have been an email, they are not team players and you should beware.
